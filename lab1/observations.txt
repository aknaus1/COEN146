# Title: Lab1 – observations
# Description: Record observations

Step 1: Easy copy and paste
Step 2: Compiled program using gcc part1-4.c -o program1
Step 3: Run program with executable ./program1
    Results in segmentation fault because the program needs an argument
Step 4: Rerun program with executable and argument ./program1 3000
    argument is delay time in microseconds
    a) repeat with arguments 500 and 5000
        500 runs faster
Step 5: Recreated with threads
Step 6 & 7: Imported math.h for pow function, and created functions factorial and sum
    Results:
        Circuit switching scenario
            6a: 10
        Packet switching scenario
            7a: 0.100000
            7b: 0.900000
            7c: 0.150095
            7d: 0.015009
            7e: 0.285180
            7f: 3.8742e-11
            7g: 3.57891e-06
